1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.790
All right, and now we're at the section of the course where we're going to

2
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.420
start talking

3
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.400
about ERC 20s and tokens.

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.150
So you can find the code associated with what we're going through in the GitHub

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.640
repo, of

6
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.480
course, associated with this course.

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.140
Now before we actually even go into building one of these, I know we've

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.880
actually worked

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.040
with them a little bit with the link token, but let's actually understand what

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.480
an ERC

11
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.080
20 is, what an EI P is, what an ERC is.

12
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.680
And I actually have video for my previous course, which goes over this.

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.920
So let's go ahead and watch that.

14
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.860
Before we can understand what an ERC 20 is or even what one of these tokens are

15
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.320
, we first

16
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.840
need to understand what is an ERC and then also what is an EIP.

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.680
In Ethereum and Avalanche and Binance and Polygon, all these blockchains have

18
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.120
what's

19
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.000
called improvement proposals.

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.440
And for Ethereum, they're called Ethereum improvement proposals or EIPs.

21
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.630
And what people would do is they come up with these ideas to improve Ethereum

22
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.480
or improve

23
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.520
these layer ones like Polygon, Matic, Avalanche, etc.

24
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.200
And on some GitHub or some open source repository, they'll add these new EIPs.

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.920
They'll add these new improvement ideas to make these protocols better.

26
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.600
Now these improvements can really be anything.

27
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.160
It can be anything from a core blockchain update to some standard that is going

28
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.280
to be

29
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.520
a best practice for the entire community to adopt.

30
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.520
Once an EIP gets enough insight, they also create an ERC, which stands for

31
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.680
Ethereum request

32
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.680
for comments.

33
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.520
So EIP, Ethereum improvement proposals, ERC, Ethereum request for comments.

34
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.720
And again, these can be like BEP, PEP, etc.

35
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.610
For all these different blockchains, both the improvement proposals and the

36
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.120
request for

37
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.440
comments all have these different tags.

38
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.800
Now, they're numbered chronologically.

39
00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.600
So something like an ERC 20 is going to be the 20th ERC/EIP.

40
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.000
The ERCs and the EIPs share that same number.

41
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.470
And their websites like EIPs.Athereum.org, they keep track of all these new

42
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.560
Ethereum improvement

43
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.560
proposals.

44
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560
And you can actually see them real time go through the process of being adopted

45
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.880
by the

46
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.880
community.

47
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.830
Now, one of these EIPs or ERCs is going to be the ERC 20 or the token standard

48
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.520
for smart

49
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.520
contracts.

50
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.690
This is an improvement proposal that talks about how to actually create tokens

51
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.360
and create

52
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.360
these smart contract tokens.

53
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.400
I made a video about this recently.

54
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.550
So in the GitHub repo associated with this course, we're going to have a sub

55
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.080
lesson and

56
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.500
we're going to watch a quick video that explains more about these different

57
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.760
tokens.

58
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.760
Now, first, let's define even what are ERC 20s.

59
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.260
Your ERC 20s are tokens that are deployed on a chain using what's called the E

60
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.960
RC 20

61
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.960
token standard.

62
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.650
You can read more about it in the ERC 20 token standard here, link in the

63
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.240
description

64
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.240
as well.

65
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.160
But basically, it's a smart contract that actually represents a token.

66
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.360
So it's token, but it's smart contract.

67
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.360
It's both.

68
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.360
It's really cool.

69
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.280
Tether, Chainlink, Unitoken and Die are all examples of ERC 20s.

70
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.990
Technically, Chainlink is in the ERC 677 as there are upgrades to the ERC 20

71
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.120
that some tokens

72
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.640
take that are still backwards compatible with ERC 20s.

73
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.780
And so basically, you can think of them as ERC 20s with a little additional

74
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.720
functionality.

75
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.560
Now, why would I even care to want to make an ERC 20?

76
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.320
Well, you can do a lot of really cool stuff with it.

77
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.600
You make governance token, you can secure an underlying network.

78
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.600
You can create some type of synthetic asset or really anything else.

79
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.600
In any case, how do we build one of these ERC 20s?

80
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.440
How do we build one of these tokens?

81
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.410
Well, all we have to do is build a smart contract that follows the token

82
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.280
standard.

83
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.980
All we have to do is build a smart contract that has these functions, that has

84
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.320
a name

85
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.600
function, a symbol function, decimal function, etc.

86
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.040
All these functions, we need to be able to transfer it.

87
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.920
We need to be able to get the balance of it, etc.

88
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.490
And again, if you want to check out some of the improvements that are still ERC

89
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.880
20 compatible,

90
00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.540
like the ERC 677 or the ERC 777, you definitely go check those out and build

91
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.280
one of those
